First, let's break down the steps we need to take:

    Create a form to input event details.
    Add functionality to save the event to a calendar.
    Create a form to input friend's free times.
    Add functionality to match available free times.
--------------------------------
    Create a project in Google Cloud Console and enable Google Calendar API.
    Create OAuth 2.0 credentials for the project to authorize our application.
    Install Google.Apis.Calendar NuGet package in our application to use the API.
    Implement authentication and authorization flow to get user consent to access their calendar.
    Implement functionality to add events to the user's calendar and match available free times with friends.
-----------------------------
Here are the steps we need to follow to use Google Calendar API in our C# WinForms application:

    Go to Google Cloud Console and create a new project by clicking on "Select a project" dropdown menu on top of the page and then "New Project" button.

    In the "Create a project" dialog, enter a name for your project and click on "Create".

    Once your project is created, click on the "Enable APIs and Services" button.

    Search for "Google Calendar API" and click on it.

    Click on the "Enable" button to enable the API for your project.

    Next, we need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials to authorize our application. In the sidebar, click on "Credentials" and then "Create credentials" button.

    Select "OAuth client ID" and choose "Desktop app" as the application type.

    Give a name to your OAuth client ID and click on "Create".

    In the "OAuth client created" dialog, click on "Download" to download your client secret as a JSON file.

    Now, let's install the required NuGet packages. Open your C# WinForms project in Visual Studio and install "Google.Apis.Calendar" and "Google.Apis.Auth" packages.

    Once the packages are installed, we can start coding. In the code, we need to implement the following steps:

    Authenticate and authorize the user using Google.Apis.Auth.OAuth2 library.
    Create a new event in the user's calendar using Google.Apis.Calendar.v3 library.
    Retrieve free/busy information of the user and their friends using Google.Apis.Calendar.v3 library.
    Match available free times and display the results.
